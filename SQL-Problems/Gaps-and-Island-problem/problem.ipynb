    "Gaps and Island problem is a classic problem of finding missing values AKA gaps or islands in a sequence of values. For cases, like with finding period of inactivity between certail interval by an employee is a gaps problem while if the data reporting is done at a certain interval and find period of activity across multiple periods is an island problem. For eg: in a table with employee name, floor number the employee has worked on and the start and end time when he worked on the floor"
